# SID_Models
A repository to store all of my epidemiological predictive models, including a basic SIR model and it's modifications. This repository also has some other fun models, including the SIInZD model for zombie outbreaks, and a model to predict the population growth of the Diclonious race from Elfen Lied. These models are written in C++ and use OpenCL.
